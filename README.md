# GitTerra

A git-based game running in CI/CD and played by coding

## Playing the game

Every time you push to your repository, GitTerra will analyze your code and generate the game map.

You can see generated map of your city / code in the pipeline's artifacts - deploy it to a web server of your choice or download to a local machine, it is up to you.
